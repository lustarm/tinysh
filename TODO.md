- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features.
- [ ] Address any bugs, issues, or user feedback.

## Milestone 10: Final Cleanup and Optimization

- [ ] Review code for clarity and optimization.
- [ ] Remove any debug statements or temporary code.
- [ ] Ensure the shell is well-organized and follows best practices.

## Milestone 11: User Testing

- [ ] Share the shell with others for user testing and feedback.
- [ ] Make any necessary adjustments based on user feedback.

## Milestone 12: Project Completion

- [ ] Prepare the project for a final release.
- [ ] Write a README file with usage instructions and examples.
- [ ] Share the project with others through GitHub or another platform.
